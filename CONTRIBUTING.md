# Contributing to Aeon

Thanks for helping make Aeon the default way people run autonomous agents. This guide collects the conventions already used across the repo so you don't have to reverse-engineer them from existing PRs.

Most contributions fall into one of four buckets — **a new skill**, **a new LLM gateway**, a **community skill pack** listing, or a **core fix** (dashboard, scripts, workflows, docs). Each has its own checklist below.

## Before you start

- **Fork or use the template.** This repo is a public template — click **Use this template** (or `gh repo fork aaronjmars/aeon --clone`). Run your own instance as a fork; open PRs back here for changes that benefit everyone.
- **Branch from `main`.** Never push to `main`. Use a descriptive branch name (`feat/...`, `fix/...`, `docs/...`).
- **One change per PR.** A focused 20-line fix lands faster than a 500-line bundle. Don't mix a new skill with an unrelated refactor.
- **PRs are squash-merged.** Write a clear PR title — it becomes the commit subject on `main`. Squashing also rewrites per-skill commit hashes, which is why the CI gate below normalizes them.

## Contributing a skill

A skill is a single `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` prompt file plus a registration in `aeon.yml`. The fastest paths:

```bash
./new-from-template <template> <skill-name>   # scaffold from skill-templates/
./add-skill <owner/repo> <skill> [skill...]   # import from any GitHub repo
```

You can also describe one to the `create-skill` skill, or label a GitHub issue `ai-build` and let Aeon implement it and open the PR.

### Frontmatter contract

Every `SKILL.md` opens with YAML frontmatter. The full contract lives in [`skill-templates/TEMPLATE.md`](skill-templates/TEMPLATE.md); the essentials:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: One-line description of what this skill does
var: ""
tags: [dev, crypto]
requires: [XAI_API_KEY, COINGECKO_API_KEY?]   # bare = required · `?` = works better with
mcp: [base]                                    # MCP servers, same two tiers
---
```

- `requires:` is the **single source of truth** the dashboard reads to show which skill needs which key. Use the exact env-var name. A bare name is required; a trailing `?` means the skill still runs without it (degraded). Omit `requires:` (or use `[]`) for skills that only need the built-in Claude + GitHub tokens.
- `mcp:` declares [MCP servers](README.md#mcp-servers-in-skill-runs) the skill calls, with the same two-tier semantics. Slugs reference `apps/dashboard/lib/mcp-catalog.ts`.
- Match the names to the registry in [`apps/dashboard/app/api/secrets/route.ts`](apps/dashboard/app/api/secrets/route.ts) so the dashboard can describe the key and link where to get it.

### Write the skill body

- **Be explicit and self-contained.** A skill runs unattended — spell out the steps, the data sources, and what to do on failure.
- **Add a "Sandbox note".** GitHub Actions blocks `$ENV_VAR` expansion in `curl` headers and may block outbound network from bash. Use the right fallback: a WebFetch fallback for keyless public APIs, a `scripts/prefetch-*.sh` cache for auth'd APIs, or `gh api` for GitHub. See [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md#sandbox-limitations).
- **Notify through `./notify`** — never call a channel API directly. It fans out to every configured channel and silently skips the rest.
- **Don't monkey-patch Aeon internals.** A skill should be a prompt, not a patch to the runner, scheduler, or dashboard.

### Regenerate the catalog

`skills.json` is the canonical machine-readable catalog (the dashboard, `./add-skill`, and downstream consumers all read it). It is **generated**, never hand-edited:

```bash
./generate-skills-json   # then commit the result
```

The `ci-skills-json` workflow fails any PR that touches `skills/**`, `aeon.yml`, `generate-skills-json`, or `skills.json` without committing a fresh regen. The check normalizes out the `generated` timestamp and per-skill `sha`/`updated`, so only real catalog drift fails it.

## Contributing an LLM gateway

A gateway is wired through **five files**, all following the existing pattern — copy an entry of the same tier (**native**: already speaks the Anthropic API; **sidecar**: OpenAI-compatible, bridged per run). The exact checklist is in the README: [Adding a gateway](README.md#adding-a-gateway).

1. `apps/dashboard/lib/types.ts` — add the slug to the `GatewayProvider` union and `GATEWAY_PROVIDERS`.
2. `apps/dashboard/lib/auth-provider.mjs` — add `slug: { label, secretName, prefixes }`.
3. `apps/dashboard/app/api/secrets/route.ts` — list the secret in `BUILTIN_SECRETS` and map it in `GATEWAY_SECRETS`.
4. `scripts/llm-gateway.sh` — add a `case` branch and register the slug + secret in the auto-resolver order.
5. `.github/workflows/aeon.yml` (and `messages.yml`) — pass the new secret into the run's `env:`.

Then add a row to the gateway table in the README. Verify the loop end to end: paste a key in the dashboard and run any skill — the log should print `::notice:: gateway=auto resolved to <slug>`.

## Listing a community skill pack

Skill packs are third-party skill collections in their own repos, installable as one bundle. To list yours in the README's [Community skill packs](README.md#community-skill-packs) table, open a PR that:

- Adds a README table row linking to your public repo, with the skill count and a one-line description.
- Adds a matching entry to [`skill-packs.json`](skill-packs.json) — the machine-readable mirror.
- Confirms the pack has a `skills-pack.json` manifest, a clear license, and a per-skill `SKILL.md`.

Packs must not monkey-patch Aeon internals or depend on private endpoints. Full schema and trust model: [`docs/community-skill-packs.md`](docs/community-skill-packs.md).

## Continuous integration

Two locking gates run on every PR. Both are fast and only trigger on the paths they protect:

| Gate | Triggers on | What it enforces |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| `ci-skills-json` | `skills/**`, `aeon.yml`, `generate-skills-json`, `skills.json` | `skills.json` matches a fresh `./generate-skills-json` |
| `ci-capabilities-parity` | `install-skill-pack`, `docs/CAPABILITIES.md`, the parity script | the capabilities taxonomy stays in sync across its sources |

If `ci-capabilities-parity` fails, you changed one side of the taxonomy without the other — run `bash scripts/check-capabilities-parity.sh` locally to see the diff.

## Reporting bugs and requesting features

Open an issue. For a bug, include the skill name, the relevant (redacted) `memory/logs/` entry, whether the failure was an API or sandbox issue, and whether notifications came through. For a feature you'd like Aeon to build itself, label the issue `ai-build`.
